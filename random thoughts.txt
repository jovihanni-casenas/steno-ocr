observations:
- once the preprocessed image is resized into a smaller one,
  some pixels turn gray and no longer black and white,
  can refer to the flattened_images.txt file, you can see values
  that are not 0 and 255

recommendation for preprocessing to POSSIBLY shorten its runtime:
-take valid contours and crop first
-this cropped, but not resized image, shall be used for rotation
-take contours again and crop
-resize to desired size
